Advanced Deep Learning for Robotics - SS24 - Project 12: Trajectory Planning with Moving Obstacles

## Getting Started

Assuming you have your preferred virtual environment set up, the environments in this repository have to be registered:

```bash
pip install -e adlr_environments/
```

Then simply run the simulation and witness astonishing random movements:

```bash
python simulation.py
```
